# Data-Modeling-With-Postgres
```
In this project we are creating an ETL pipeline to create and popuate the star schema with data in Postgres to optimize the data analytics for Sparkify. We have the following star schema 

Fact Table:
    Fact table stores the quantifiable metrics which can be aggreagted to get useful results. We have following fact table.
    1. songplays - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong

Dimension Tables:
    Dimnesion Tables stores the business events related to the facts. We have following dimension tables.
    1. users - users in the app
    
    2. songs - songs in music database

    3. artists - artists in music database

    4. time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
